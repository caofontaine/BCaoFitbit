# BCao Fitbit

This project was designed to serve as a aggregate of the continuation of learning I have done with web development technologies and a challenge for myself to see the fruits of my labor.

One of the things that interests me the most is being able to take data from some place and make it visually appealing.

The data was taken from my own Fitbit, focusing on the step data. From there, the data was broken down to show the number of steps taken for a year or a certain month in a year. In addition to that, since Fitbit allows you to set a goal for total number of steps you take each day, I mapped out a total of days hit or miss of my specified step goal.

Using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, AngularJS), in conjunction with Google Charts, this was achieved.
